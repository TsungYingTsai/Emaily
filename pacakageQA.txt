NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client

first part, NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false, is to tell heroku (or any deployment platform) we want to install dependencies
not only on production but also for development side

Before next, something needs to point out first, the way we deploy on development and production are different.
In local machine, react(client) and nodejs sides can be distinguished and responsible for their own role.
But in production mode, nodejs needs to be in charge of both client and server sides tasks.
In this way, trickly, we need to specifically tell heroku to install the dependencies installed in the client side.
And we also need to build the client side production through nodejs. These are reasons why we do
npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client here.
